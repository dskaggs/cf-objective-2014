        <li>Could just use Java driver but why reinvent the wheel</li>
        <li>TODO: say something about syntax here</li>
        <li>multiple people already have done a lot of work to make it easy to communicate with MongoDB through the Java driver</li>
        <li>allows nearly seamless translating of ColdFusion structs and arrays to MongoDB and vice versa</li>
